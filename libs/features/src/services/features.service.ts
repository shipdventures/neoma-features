/**
 * Request-scoped programmatic access to feature flag state.
 *
 * Use when a handler must always run but needs to conditionally vary
 * behaviour based on a flag — e.g. "always accept the upload, but only
 * compute an AI summary if DOCUMENT_AI_SUMMARY is enabled for this user."
 *
 * `isEnabled(name)` evaluates the exact admit rule the `FeatureGuard`
 * evaluates for `@Feature(name)` on the same request:
 *
 *     admit = flags?.[name] === true
 *          || (await resolve?.(req))?.[name] === true
 *
 * The resolver (if configured) is invoked with the live express `Request`
 * for the in-flight HTTP call. Each call to `isEnabled` invokes the
 * resolver independently — no memoisation. If the consumer needs caching,
 * they memoise inside their own resolver.
 *
 * A resolver rejection propagates unchanged.
 *
 * Because the service is `Scope.REQUEST`, it must be used from
 * request-scoped or per-call providers. Injecting it into a singleton
 * construction path is a consumer error — DI will either fail or promote
 * the singleton to request scope.
 *
 * @example In-handler branching
 * ```typescript
 * @Injectable()
 * export class DocumentsService {
 *   constructor(private readonly features: FeaturesService) {}
 *
 *   async upload(file: Buffer) {
 *     const doc = await this.store(file)
 *     if (await this.features.isEnabled("DOCUMENT_AI_SUMMARY")) {
 *       doc.summary = await this.summarise(file)
 *     }
 *     return doc
 *   }
 * }
 * ```

  /**
   * Returns `true` when the named feature flag is enabled for the
   * in-flight request, `false` otherwise.
   *
   * Mirrors the `FeatureGuard` admit rule exactly: the static `flags`
   * map short-circuits the resolver when it already admits. A resolver
   * that rejects propagates its rejection unchanged.
   *
   * @param name - The feature flag name to check.
   * @returns Whether the flag admits for this request.
   *
   * @example
   * ```typescript
   * if (await this.features.isEnabled("DOCUMENT_AI_SUMMARY")) {
   *   // branch taken only when enabled for this request
   * }
   * ```
